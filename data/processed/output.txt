Chose Mistral 7B for this task to be ﬁne-tuned.

● Created dataset including pair of natural language prompt and SPARQL queries with help of OpenAI API.

Applied standard data preparation and cleaning techniques to make sure we have as much clean data as possible.

● Another local LLM was used - Llama3.1:8B, Llama3.1:70B, Falcon2:11B, Mixtral 8x7B , for giving the result in natural language that is fetched by SPARQL query from Wikidata API and also takes in user prompt which is initially prompted to the ﬁne-tuned LLM.

● Heavy Prompt Engineering was involved for second LLM such that it doesnt use its internal knowledge to answer prompt entered by user if the SPARQL query doesnt return proper response and made it adhere to only generate response from query results.

● For best user experience, developed streaming chatbot on Streamlit such that the user doesn’t have to wait for whole result looking at the screen.

● Created an automated pipeline for transforming text, PDF, and CSV ﬁles into Neo4J graph database structures using advanced prompt engineering techniques.

Additionally, implemented a natural language processing system capable of translating complex, conversational queries into Cypher, enabling sophisticated interactions with the Neo4j database.

● Performed LoRA Training of Flux Dev - Text to Image Generation model for a character mascot required for memecoin.

OpenAI API was used for captioning images in the dataset.

The trained adaptor was then used in the ComfyUI workﬂow.

1 ● Inference and Fine-Tuning are performed over inhouse RTX-4090 GPUs.

August 2023 - November 2023 Spotnik Technology, Dubai UAE - Freelance Data Scientist ● Devised strategic plans for three key projects, focusing on enhancing pedestrian walkability , happiness , and sustainability scores within urban zones.

● Employed industry-standard data engineering techniques to construct comprehensive datasets for each project, ensuring robust analysis and insights.

This framework was pivotal across all projects.

● Leveraged Terraform for efﬁcient AWS Cloud resource management, deploying dockerized models on EC2 instances with FastAPI , and developed intuitive UIs using Jinja Templates for ML endpoint evaluation.

July 2022 - November 2023 NewsReels Information Technology, Dubai UAE - Data Scientist My role is to develop, and deploy robust Machine Learning ( ML) models using PyTorch and HuggingFace libraries, preprocess data for achieving desired results from models to be trained, design stable API endpoints, and construct ETL pipelines to streamline data integration.

Throughout the process, continuously optimized model performance and inference speed to achieve exceptional results.

● Trained Text To Speech (TTS) Model from scratch for both English (Indian Accent) and Hindi Languages based on VITs Algorithm that yields very realistic human sounding output.

Fine-tuned Whisper Speech-to-Text (STT) model for Hindi Language achieved Word Error Rate (WER) of 12%.

● Dataset for TTS was created using custom voice, producing a 50-hours each English and Hindi datasets based on various news topics, ensuring the TTS could pronounce all words properly.

Dataset for ﬁne-tuning STT model was created using over 500 different speakers' recordings from various resources, totalling 100-hours.

● Utilized both BERT and SpaCy models for achieving very accurate results for multilingual Keywords Classiﬁcation and Extraction tasks.

● Built and containerized API endpoints for custom and pre-trained Machine Learning models using Docker and FastAPI library and AWS s3 storage for intermediary storage of the output produced by ML Models.

● Developed a robust ETL Engine that extracts data from NoSQL MongoDB databases and updates other databases upon completion of automated jobs, streamlining data management and facilitating efﬁcient workﬂows.

● Developed applications using ChatGPT API from OpenAI and utilized state-of-the-art LangChain and Llama-Index libraries for using the Large Language Models (gpt-4, chatgpt-3.5 turbo and text-davinci-003).

● Utilizing the Prompt Engineering technique, have achieved exceptional results from the ChatGPT API while optimizing token usage .

This method has also been employed to generate exceptional beautiful digital art using Stability Diffusion XL Models, further demonstrating its effectiveness.

● Developed realistic Text to Audio Voice Clone system allows to replicate voice of an individual as well as allow to include expressions e.g.

happy, sad, laughter via Prompt Engineering followed by creating its API.

Comprehensive measures have been incorporated into the design to ensure ethical use and respect for privacy.

● Developed automated music generation system that makes use of Music Prompts generated by ChatGPT API as per the instructions stored in database and AudioCraft Library package.

2 June 2019 - July 2022 Etisalat Service Holdings - Tamdeed Projects, Dubai, UAE - Technical Support Specialist ● Helped the business maximize revenue by identifying business insights and KPIs achieved on a given date, performing time series analysis using Pandas and Plotly for forecasting and create interactive visualizations .
